# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
 - staff.name
```

```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - Encapsulation is restricting access to parts of code except for where that code is needed to keep projects organized.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - single-responsibility
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - The Class is the blueprint that all instances will come from, an instance is one object created from that class.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - A proxy object wraps an object and calls the operations of that object.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - MVC improves the organization of projects by seperating the tasks of getting input, logic, etc.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - The controller talks to the dom and gets the input from the user to trigger events but doesn't handle the logic of the events.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - The Service takes the input from the controller and handles whatever logic needs done for the event
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 - the model is the template for a type of object in the project. It holds how the object is displayed and what properties and attributes it has.
```
