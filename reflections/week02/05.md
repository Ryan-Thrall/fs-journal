# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
 - I got better a lot better with understanding more complex objects
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
 - I was already pretty familiar with javascript but using figma helped the speed of the design a lot more than I thought it would
- What are you struggling with?
 - My designs in figma and layouts could be nicer.
- What would you count as a victory?
 - finishing the checkpoint with being busy and wifi issues.
