## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
 - The Scope of a variable is where it is available to use.
2. What is Hoisting ?
 - Hoisting is where variables and functions are moved to the top of the code execution so we can use them before the line they've been declared on.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
 - var is outdated and probably doesn't need to be used or should be used when you need the variable to be specifically globally scoped or function scoped. Let should be used whenever you need a variable that may change values at any point in the program. Const should be used when you know the value of the variable does not needed to be changed.
