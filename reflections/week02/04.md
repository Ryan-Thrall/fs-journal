## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
 - planning before coding will make sure that all your systems will work together nicely, as well as make the code easier to structure, read, and edit.
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
 - Google the problem and how people have solved or embraced it, than figure out how to implement a solution you've found. If that solution doesn't work, don't get fixated on it and look for a work around or new solution.
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
 - All the organizing code, and planning before coding, is more efficient in the long run even though it's not technically required to write software. Rushing implementation is a common mistake that will cause issues on bigger projects.
