## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
 - Pending, Resolved, and Rejected
2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
 - promises allow us to call .then and .catch after the function and write that code somewhere else rather than nesting each step of the process inside each other.
3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
 - then() is ran after a promise is resolved, while catch() is ran after a promise is rejected
