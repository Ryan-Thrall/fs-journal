# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
 - I completed the important parts of the projects while training and having a life outside of code.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
 - async methods allow us to do things in the background without having to wait for each process before being able to do the next thing.
- What are you struggling with?
 - Timeboxing and avoiding burnout from attempting to add too much to projects.
- What would you count as a victory?
 - I completed everything with enough energy to workout consistently and have a good work life balance.
