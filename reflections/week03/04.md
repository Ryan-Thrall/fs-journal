## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
 - The Observer Pattern helps with keeping a bunch of elements synced with the same data when things change on the page.
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
 - subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
 - The template allows the largest object to write itself along with accessing templates for smaller objects inside itself so that things only need to be written to the dom in one place.
