## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
 - Encapsulation helps organize the code and improve speed by restricting access to parts of the code that are unnecessary to the current task.
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
 - Closures have to handle input, logic, and output all in the same area which gets difficult to read and organize
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
 - # will make private variables. This would be useful if the class is the only place you want to be able to access the variable and don't want other developers trying to access that variable where they aren't supposed to.
