## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
 - exports allow you to organize your code into categories and limit access to those functions so that files don't get overcrowded and functions don't accidentally call code they aren't supposed to call.
2. How does export differ from export default?
 - default exports are allowed to be anonymous or have a different name from the imported module. while regular export has to have a name and you can only have one default export.
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
 - Modules allow code to be split between files and organized, while also concatenating multiple files to increase performance.
