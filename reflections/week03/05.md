# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
 - I improved at structuring my websites with the mvc system.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
 - The number of files used was a bit of a shock.
- What are you struggling with?
 - Having the time to add styling to the projects is difficult with the time constraints but I'm understanding the structure of MVC pretty well now
- What would you count as a victory?
 - Finishing everything on time when the new system requires more time organizing than the old system.
