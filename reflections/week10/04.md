## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
 - Enums are values of pre-specified value. They are useful for making sure data is entered properly when you have a few specific options.
2. How can you modify an Enum?
 - EnumName = value changes the value from its default.
3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
 - I will use enums to force the category types to be selected by me rather than being able to put anything in as a category.
