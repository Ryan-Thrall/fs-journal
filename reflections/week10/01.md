## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
 - Value, Reference, and Pointer. Value types have a direct value such as a string or integer. Reference types refer to the value of another variable but don't change that variables value.
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
 - Bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. C# has more types that specify the potential size of the variable as well as the type.
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
 - Reference types store the address of the value instead of the value itself while value types store the value directly.
