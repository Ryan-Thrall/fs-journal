## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
 - Rows contain one object of the tables type while columns specify the data types for each object.
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
 - CREATE TABLE
 IF NOT EXISTS tableName(
  name VARCHAR(255),
  age VARCHAR(255),
  desc VARCHAR(255),
  int VARCHAR(255),
 )
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
 - The first one deletes everything from the table while the second one deletes the whole table.
