## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

 - I feel comfortable finishing the final. I understand back end quite well and have been practicing sql. The frontend is slower but not all that complicated. This has been a great course that if there was more time I'd like to learn a few more things from it. I definitely feel more comfortable with patterns and writing cleaner more readable code. It would be nice to learn how to create our own templates for personal projects rather than relying on whatever company to supply them for us, as well as how to setup the server and database from scratch without the template. But for a 12 week course it taught good practices very well and really taught the backend well where I hadn't found any good resources for backend previously.
