## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
 - One to one, One to Many, Many to Many
2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
 - Linking does not grow the object that is being linked to. Instead of a post with a bunch of comments on it, it's a single post with comments that link to it.
3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
 - How often the relationship is displayed or used and the expected number of many to many will change how it is implemented.
