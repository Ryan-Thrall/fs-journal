## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
 - Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End-to-End testing
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
 - Unit testing because components have multiple units that could be causing issues, but units are the smallest and easiest parts to fix.
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
 - Component Testing Because it is too big to be easily fixed without unit testing, and too small to test if it all works together in the end when the user is using it.
