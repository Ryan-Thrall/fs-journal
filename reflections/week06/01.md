## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?
 - Component based architecture splits up responsibility between individual components on the page rather than by individual roles with MVC.
2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
 - Component based architecture allows us to reuse templates with functionality easier on different pages and if a piece of UI is broken it's more compact and the logic is less spread out than with MVC.
3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
 - Using the same components in different pages can cause problems when certain pages have required information for the component that may be missing on the new page.
