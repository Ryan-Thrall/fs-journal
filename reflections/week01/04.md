## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
 - Wire framing is for figuring out the design before you start coding so that you can see different layouts without writing a ton of code.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
 - The levels of wire framing are low mid and high fidelity. Low-fidelity are rough outlines of the layout only to get a general idea of how the website should look. Mid-fidelity are a more accurate representation with more detail in specific components. High-fidelity are pixel-specific layouts with the actual images and content of the page written out.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
 - I think they are worth the energy because it is much easier to change your mind or try different designs and layouts in a wireframe than in code.
