## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
 - Pseudo-Classes add styles when a condition is met. We probably use hover, checked, and visited.
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
 - Specificity determines what css rules are applied based on how specific the selector is. It is useful in order to add general rules to elements but change the rules for more specific elements.
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
 - The !important feature makes the code messy and hardt o follow. It breaks the rules of specificity making it harder to make logical changes later on and for other developers.
