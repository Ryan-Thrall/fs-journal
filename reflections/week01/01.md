## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

- Git allows us to store code in a central location so it is easily accessible to all developers working on a project, as well as tracking changes and allowing developers to go back to previous versions of projects.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

- Branches allow developers to save multiple versions of the same project in case the requirements for the project change or different systems for solving problems are found.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

- Git is a version control system while github is a cloud based way to store and share code with other machines.
