# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  - Although I could have kept my tasks a bit more organized all the concepts made sense this week and I was able to apply them without much difficulty.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
   - I had never learned to pay attention to what elements have what children and sectioning areas off even if it doesn't affect the layout, but that has improved the organization of my code dramatically.
- What are you struggling with?
  - I still need practice with the bootstrap grid system and when to use it vs traditional flexbox. 
   - I also need to develop a todo list in order to make sure I'm remembering to do everything for the day and not going back to all the projects of the week on the weekend.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - I would say learning to structure the page and change the layout of the page much easier, has made my websites look a lot cleaner and easier to maintain and change than they used to be.
